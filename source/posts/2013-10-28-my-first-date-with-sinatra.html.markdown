title: My First Date with Sinatra

My first date with <a href= 'http://www.sinatrarb.com/' target= blank>Sinatra</a> was a hot mess. And that damn tipped over
rocks glass for error messages is enough to drive a girl to drink. 

Initially overly excited about building a web app, and having some
cursory experience with a little front-end dev, I decided to
approach the Sinatra tutorial with guns a blazin’ and 
follow the tutorial using <a href= 'http://haml.info/' target= blank>Haml</a> instead of ERB(which is short for "Embedded RuBy" and not to be confused with "<a href= 'http://www.epicrapbattlesofhistory.com/' target= blank>Epic Rap Battles</a>"). I mean, how hard could
it be? Talk about kicking my own ass… sheesh. First and foremost,
<a href= 'http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html'
target= blank>Ideabox</a> introduced the use of forms, which I had zero experience with
and found them to be a tiny beast of weirdness all their own. Then,
layer on top of that translating ERB instructions from the tutorial
real-time into Haml had me and the spilled glass of Jack w/ water
and three ice-cubes (the real <a href= 'http://jrcx.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/sinatrajd/' target= blank>Sinatra's poison </a> of choice) in lock step for the duration of the exercise.
And I’m a vodka girl, so it wasn’t a pleasant experience,
although spilling booze in any context is generally an unpleasant
faux-pas. So where did I end up? Well… I completed the project, so
there is that. But I certainly wasn’t proud of it and absolutely none
of it was test driven. 

I did however, learn a lot. And the post exercise where we sat with <a
href= 'https://github.com/jcasimir?source=cc' target= blank>Jeff</a>
and worked through how to approach testing with Ideabox was hugely
beneficial. That said, I would most definitely repeat the exercise,
with TDD first and foremost, as well hopefully having some time to add
more extensions and make the front-end pretty. Another piece of good
news is that re-writing the views in Haml was an extension, which
I only learned after the fact, which was a nice surprise. This
was the first project since the start of school that I was able to
complete in its entirety with an extension. **Kazaam**.

After the Sinatra shin-dig, we had our first “code retreat” at The
Source in Denver. It was like speed-dating, but with code-pairing.
And it was fantastic! All of my fellow students proved to be much
better dates than Sinatra, if for no other reason than they didn’t keep
spilling liquor on me. I especially enjoy the <a href=
'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)' target= blank>Groundhog Day</a> approach,
where we kept repeating the same exercise over and over as we changed
pairs. Even though the exercise was the same, the change in pairs
and the application of learning from one session to the next really
changed the dynamic of the exercise. Sometimes - I felt pretty stupid,
but a lot of times, I actually contributed to the process of
writing some code that worked. And that always feels great.
