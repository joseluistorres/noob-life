title: I have No Idea What I Am Doing

![](./woman_computer.png)

I tried to insert ERB tags into haml.

I got myself up "git creek" when I thought it would be cool to rebase. 

I lost hours googling my googles because I didn't understand the
answers to my noob questions.

I have yet to fully complete an in-class exercise during the allocated
class time (@ the gSchool).  

I wrote eight lines of code for Event Reporter (first "real" project
assigned with a one week turn time.) and none of them did
anything.

I spent an hour and a half relentlessly trying to debug a functional
file that wasn't even the file I was requiring in the test suite I was
working from - seriously. 

I never use the damn Pomodoro, even though I know I should, and my psyche suffers for it. 

For fuck's sake. I have no idea what I am doing.
