title: Baby Steps and Novice Love

I am currently reading a book from the <a href= "http://www.gschool.it/" target= "blank">gSchool</a> reading list called
<a href= "http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning" target= "blank">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor your Wetware</a>.
The author, Andy Hunt, dives into how our brains are
wired, and how to apply ourselves in learning new skills. It is written
with programming in mind, but uses examples and analogies that span
other professional and artistic disciplines. Andy claims:

> In this book you'll learn how to:<br>  
> + Use the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition to become more expert  
> + Leverage the architecture of the brain to strengthen different thinking modes  
> + Avoid common "known bugs" in your mind  
> + Learn more deliberately and more effectively  
> + Manage knowledge more efficiently  

Yes please. Sign me up.  

I am only on chapter three, but actually feeling like there might be hope
for me yet. He talks at length about the Dreyfus model of Skill
Acquistion in the first three chapters. I won't go into detail on the
model, but it's worth investigating further if you are so inclined.

I am a novice. And according to Andy Hunt, those who are of the novice
persuasion require a specific kind of teaching love. Here are a couple
high-level themes from the book that spoke to me personally:  

*First: Crawl, Walk, Run* 

In that order. Focus on small conceptual chunks to practice repeatedly.
Inserting appropriate variations that challenge, but are still closely
related to the same concept. This is about building a foundation through
practice, but doing it with baby steps. And, as with toddlers, create an
environment that makes lots of small wins accessible and celebrate them
to create the confidence to move through the stages of crawl, walk, run.  

*Second: Pressure Kills Cognition.*

This notion was actually detailed in chapter seven, but referenced in
chapter three. Simply put, pressure stifles creativity, it shuts down
the areas of our brain we should be accessing religiously while we
learn, in favor of a fight or flight instinct resulting from the terror
of failing to deliver. I especially had a lot of that going on for the
first three weeks of gSchool. 

These chapters really got me thinking about the particular
needs and state of mind of the novice. Mind you, it is never a
one-size-fits-all declaration, but I can attest that some of us in
school are of the particular novice persuasion who would respond better,
and grow faster, with just a few extras bolted onto the first few weeks
of school. Ideas include:<br>   
 + **Study Hall**. An hour or so, 2-3 times per week, before or after class
   to focus on the fundamentals. To revisit again and again the concepts
   and problems presented in class that are escaping us.<br>  
 + **Mentors at the Start**. If it were possible to introduce a few mentors
   at the start of the program, this would be amazing. Sometimes, we
   masochistic novices struggle too long and too hard, to the point of
   total breakdown, and having additional resources who were available
   more frequently, especially in the off-hours, could really make the
   difference in our ability to jump the big hurdles and gain much needed
   confidence.<br>  
 + **Baby Step Tutorials**. Smaller chunks of learning exercises
   that force us to repeat the little things and apply them
   progressively, in a building block format.<br>  
 + **Invitation to Pace**. This, for me, is critical. While it is true we
   don't receive traditional grades in gSchool, I spent the first three
   weeks beating myself up because I couldn't finish everything, and the
   first project, I can't even say I really started. And I was beginning
   to lose faith in the process, and even worse, myself. And I found the
   messages around the importance of finishing the first few projects to
   be rather inconsistent. And it was hard to prioritize what I should
   be focused on in order to avoid being left behind, or miss something
   critical to my success. Might seem trivial in hindsight, but as a
   noob, I don't know what I don't know, and even the little things get
   overwhelming.<br>   
 + **More Pictures**. The diagrams and the whiteboards help a lot. Even when
   its just writing code on the wall with markers, it is wonderful. I
   think this is because it forces everyone to slow down. For the novice
   crew, sometimes we find ourselves struggling to just keep up with all
   the window hopping and fast code typing on the screen during class
   instruction and that often causes unintended consequences of not
   really listening (because we are panicked about keeping up), or just
   checking out because we miss one step and suddenly find ourselves in
   no-man's land without a clue as to what question to even ask.<br> 

That's all I got for right now. I only read three chapters, however
Katrina contributed a very thorough analysis on the Jumpstart Blog <a href= "http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2013/10/03/pragmatic-learning-at-gschool-part-i" target="blank">Jumpstart Blog</a> , so you should definitely check it out. There will be more to come as we
finish the book over the next couple weeks.

And the best part about reading this book, is that gSchool is reading it
with me. And most importantly, they are switching gears in some of the
areas listed above in order to make me successful. There is no question
this is the right place for learning to program and they are the best at
what they do (and because they listen and care, my desire to punch them
in the nose on a couple early occasions was only fleeting).
