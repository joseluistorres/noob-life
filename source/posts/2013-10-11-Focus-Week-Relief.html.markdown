title: Focus Week Relief
---

![](images/woman_couch.png)

So we just finished our first of three focus weeks at the <a href= "http://www.gschool.it/" target= "blank">gSchool</a>, and
it could not have come at a better time -- well, except maybe a little
earlier. Seriously - I think I've been desperate for a focus week. A
break in the fierce treading of water that is the daily grind of class
instruction and looming project deliverables, due dates, and
overall feeling of having no idea what the hell I am doing. 

Focus week was the invitation to pump the brakes and slow down long enough
to ensure we were grounded in the code we were writing. In such that
even if it wasn't a lot of code, it was code we understood. So I
feel better about a lot of the fundamentals, in terms of understanding
how to work with hashes, arrays, strings, methods, and most
importantly, a better understanding of the ruby object model. I'm not
sure I "mastered" anything, or that I even know what that might look
like, but I do feel there was some progression and that I was able to
take a moment to just breathe (insert momentary sigh of relief here). 

Also, we were divided into groups of similar skill level and the
smaller group atmosphere was super <a href= "http://www.themovierad.com/#!/Home" target= "blank">RAD</a>. I don't necessarily think it is required for the full 24 weeks of the
course, but I think it's needed a LOT more. The small group approach
created a dynamic where I actually felt like I was learning *with*
people, as opposed to just trying to hang on for dear life to the coat
tails of those who seem light years ahead of me. Whether or not they are in fact light years ahead of me is irrelevant. Perception is reality and as a noob on the Planet of Programming, sometimes this is my reality:

I also found the small groups were more vocal in class, and I believe that is because we all felt safer with
one another, in that our contributions and questions were useful for
everyone.   
Next week we start web applications. I have no expectations,
other than I would really like to finish the project on time. I assume
it will be hard, but I'm hoping it doesn't feel impossible like
some of the last projects.

And lastly, even though I feel a little better right now, I know
another big tidal wave is just around the corner, waiting to smash
my noob face into the ground. 

Bring it. \<sigh\>
